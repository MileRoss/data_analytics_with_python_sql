While JSON looks similar to the dictionaries we're used to in Python, it's worth noting that when represented as raw text (e.g., in an API response), the entire JSON structure is a *string*.

    "##### 3. **Header Parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are included in the request header and can be used for various purposes, such as authentication (e.g., sending an API key or token), content negotiation (e.g., defining the response format), or custom settings defined by the API. If the API requires authentication, you might include an `Authorization` header with your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "ISS API mentions that *currently there is no authentication required*. So we'll look at an example with a different API of `authentication` in `header parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Request Headers\n",
    "Request headers are key-value pairs sent in an HTTP request to provide information about the request itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some request headers are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type of the resource or data. Common examples include \"application/json\" for JSON data, \"text/html\" for HTML content, and \"application/xml\" for XML data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Authorization**: Contains credentials for authenticating the client with the server, often used with tokens or other forms of authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **User-Agent**: Provides information about the client (browser or other client), including its version and operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python's `requests` library, you can include headers in a request by using the `headers` argument, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'}\n",
    "response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️🚨 ¡Careful with the authentication token! ⚠️🚨  A token is a personal credential for accessing an API, through which your request quota to the API is managed. Therefore, the ideal procedure is to ensure security by storing the token as a variable in an .env file. This way, you can call the environment variable without having to publicly display the token.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: News API**\n",
    "\n",
    "The *News API* lets you locate articles and breaking news headlines from news sources and blogs across the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the [NewsAPI Authentication documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs/authentication). It mentions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You can attach your API key to a request in one of three ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via the apiKey querystring parameter.\n",
    "- Via the X-Api-Key HTTP header.\n",
    "- Via the Authorization HTTP header. Including Bearer is optional, and be sure not to base 64 encode it like you may have seen in other authentication tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "We strongly recommend the either of last two so that your API key isn't visible to others in logs or via request sniffing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't append your API key correctly, or your API key is invalid, you will receive a 401 - Unauthorized HTTP error.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let's look at the documentation for the endpoints to see what **parameters** they accept: [NewsAPI endpoints](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints). We see we have the endpoint `/v2/top-headlines` – *returns breaking news headlines for countries, categories, and singular publishers. This is perfect for use with news tickers or anywhere you want to use live up-to-date news headlines.*\n",
    "If we look at the [documentation of that endpoint](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) we see we have more parameters we can add such as `country` or `category`."

    "\n",
    "Lets do with a correct key. You should get your own API key through their website. Once we've saved our key, we'll send it via the X-Api-Key HTTP header.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Saving the API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Storing an API key directly in your code can expose sensitive information, especially if your code is publicly available (e.g., on a public GitHub repository). The best practice for saving and loading an API key in your code involves the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Storing the API Key**:\n",
    "    - **Use Environment Variables**: Store your API key in an environment variable on your system. This keeps the key out of your codebase and allows you to change it without altering your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Create a .env File**: If you prefer, you can create a `.env` file (just call it `.env` nothing else before the `.`) in your project directory to store the API key. Inside this file, you would have something like:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       ```\n",
    "       API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n",
    "       ```\n",
    "\n",
    "        - **Add .env to .gitignore**: If you're using a version control system like Git, make sure to add the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file. This prevents the `.env` file (and therefore your API key) from being uploaded to any public repositories. We'll talk about Git and .gitignore in more detail soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load the Key in Your Code**: \n",
    "\n",
    "    You can use libraries like `python-dotenv` to load the key into your code. \n",
    "    You would need to install `python-dotenv` first.\n",
    "    ```python \n",
    "    !pip install python-dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "    from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "\n",
    "    load_dotenv()\n",
    "    api_key = os.getenv(\"API_KEY\")\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Now, `api_key` contains the value of your API key, and you can use it to authenticate your requests to the API.\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "Lets do the second approach. Lets save it in an env file and save it in a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your file is named .env and not .env.txt! Is one of the most common errors. If you need, look at the document properties to make sure it doesn't have .txt at the end even if its not showing the .txt when looking at your folder."
